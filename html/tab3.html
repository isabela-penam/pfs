<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
  </li>
  <p>
    It can be observed how the figures are decreasing <br />
    periodically and the points are very dispersed with respect<br />
    to the linear regression
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The relation among the dots regarding the colors.
  </li>
  <p>
    The figures are relatively far from linear regression, <br />
    especially in months 1 (December) and 3 (February).
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>281,8</p>

  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    One way to reduce the consumption of electrical energy<br />
    can be to turn off the television when we are not at home <br />
    and only leave the stereo on so the dog can listen to music, <br />
    and if we go out at night, only leave a light on and not 3 ofÂ them
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
  </li>
  <p>
    The graph starts with a progressive increase and<br />
    finally has a fairly high peak.
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The relation among the dots regarding the colors.
  </li>
  <p>
    The data is quite related to linear regression,<br />
    there are no abrupt changes and they follow a stable line.
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>24.248,18</p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    linear regression describes the relationship between<br />
    all the data obtained, and helps to create a prediction <br />
    of the next value of energy consumption in the home.
  </p>
</ul>
