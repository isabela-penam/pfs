    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.

    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">
              The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
            </li>
          <p>It can be seen that during the five months there was an increase<br />
             from December to March but a decrease from March to April
        </p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">
              The relation among the dots regarding the colors.
            </li>
          <p>The red dots are scattered but close to the gray line
        </p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">
              Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
            </li>
          <p>133.7
        </p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">
              A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
            </li>
          <p>In my opinion, consumption is constant and an increase can be observed,<br />
             but in the last month there has been a decrease in consumption.<br />
              The consumption in my house seems good to me
        </p>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>

    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">
          The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
        </li>
      <p>There are very similar energy consumption, clearly some consume more<br />
         than others, either due to greater spending or number of people
    </p>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">
          The relation among the dots regarding the colors.
        </li>
      <p>At the start there are five points close to each other but the<br />
         others are scattered,and there are only three near the gray line,<br />
          the rest are far away
    </p>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">
          Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
        </li>
      <p>11,804.23
    </p>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">
          A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.
        </li>
      <p>the consumption seems good to me regarding the number of people<br />
         who live in the houses, however there are some cases that exceed<br />
          the level of consumption
    </p>
      </ul>
