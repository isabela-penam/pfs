<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
  </li>
  <p>
    According to the data collected we can say there is an increasement<br />
    of the KWH used per month (each month from december to april)<br />
    December being short by 18 KWH in comparison to april
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The relation among the dots regarding the colors.
  </li>
  <p>
    The red dots (the energy consumption) have a close proximity to the grey
    ones<br />
    (these being the average number between the energy consumption <br />
    of these 5 months)
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>
    129.1
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    It is important to say that the consumption of energy in my house is not an
    <br />
    elevated number, but if we have to reduce it, then we should keep<br />
    the lights off while is still daylight
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
  </li>
  <p>
    At the beginning of the Regression lines all the dots are really close to
    each other <br />
    and have a constant variety of numbers(regarding the energy consumption and
    the members of <br />
    the family)and then we have a really elevated consumption number and family
    members (728KWH and 8 family memebers)
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    The relation among the dots regarding the colors.
  </li>
  <p>
    All the dots and the Regression lines are really close to each other, except
    for <br />
    the last (which is a really high number).
  </p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>23,174.35</p>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    The linear regression help us build a reference between the relation<br />
    of all the data. In this anylisis the relation between the consumption
    <br />
    and the lineal regression is really close when seeing the number of
    family<br />
    memebers (regarding families with 3 to 4 members) and their energy
    consupmtion<br />
    and it gets a little high when talking about the family of 8.
