<h3>Electric Energy</h3>

<p>
  We can define electrical energy as the <br />
  energy generated by the movement of electrons<br />
  from one point to another. The movement of <br />
  charged particles along/through a medium <br />
  (say wire)constitute current or electricity.

<h3>
  Watt (physical unit)
</h3>
<p>
  The watt unit is named after James Watt, the inventor <br />
  of the steam engine. The watt is the unit of power.<br />
  Power is the amount of energy transferred or <br />
  consumed per unit of time; equivalently, <br />
  power is the rate of doing work. In standard-speak, <br />
  the watt is the power which in one second gives<br />
  rise to energy of 1 joule.<br />
  1watt=1joule/second<br />
</p>
<h6>Formula</h6>
<p>Amps(A)* Volts(V)*Power Factor= Watts (W)</p>

<h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
<p>
  A scatterplot (AKA scatter chart, scatter graph)<br />
  uses dots to represent values for two different<br />
  numeric variables. The position of eache dot<br />
  on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates<br />
  values for an individual data point. Scatter plots<br />
  are used to to observe relationship between variables<br />
  <br />

<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
<p>
  Linear regression analysis is used to predict the<br />
  value of a variable based on the value of another variable.<br />
  The variable you want to predict is called:<br />
  the dependent variable. <br />
  The variable you are using to predict the other<br />
  variable's value is called:<br />
  the independent variable.

<h3>Renewable Energy</h3>
<p>
  Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources<br />
  that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. <br />
  Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that<br />
  are constantly being replenished.<br />
  Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.<br />

<h4>Types of Renewable Energy</h4>
<h5>Solar</h5>
<p>
  Solar energy is derived by capturing radiant energy from sunlight<br />
  and converting it into heat, electricity, or hot water.<br />
  Photovoltaic (PV) systems can convert direct sunlight into<br />
  electricity through the use of solar cells.<br />
</p>
<h5>Wind</h5>
<p>
  Wind farms capture the energy of wind flow by using turbines<br />
  and converting it into electricity. There are several <br />
  forms of systems used to convert wind energy and each vary.<br />
  Technically, wind energy is a form of solar energy. The phenomenon<br />
  we call “wind” is caused by the differences in temperature <br />
  in the atmosphere combined with the rotation of Earth and the geography<br />
  of the planet.<br />
</p>
<h5>Hydroelectric</h5>
<p>
  Is electricity produced from generators driven by turbines that convert<br />
  the potential energy of falling or fast-flowing water into mechanical energy.
</p>
<h5>Geothermal</h5>
<p>
  is heat that is trapped beneath the earth’s crust from the formation <br />
  of the Earth 4.5 billion years ago and from radioactive decay.<br />
  Sometimes large amounts of this heat escapes naturally, but all at once,<br />
  resulting in familiar occurrences, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers.<br />
  This heat can be captured and used to produce geothermal energy by using steam
  <br />
  that comes from the heated water pumping below the surface, which then rises
  to the top<br />
  and can be used to operate a turbine.
</p>
<h5>Ocean</h5>
<p>
  The ocean can produce two types of energy: thermal and mechanical. <br />
  Ocean thermal energy relies on warm water surface temperatures to<br />
  generate energy through a variety of different systems. <br />
  Ocean mechanical energy uses the ebbs and flows of the tides to generate<br />
  energy, which is created by the earth’s rotation and gravity from the moon.
</p>
<h5>Hydrogen</h5>
<p>
  Hydrogen needs to be combined with other elements, such as oxygen to make
  water<br />
  as it does not occur naturally as a gas on its own. When hydrogen is separated
  from<br />
  another element it can be used for both fuel and electricity.
</p>
<h5>Biomass</h5>
<p>
  Bioenergy is a renewable energy derived from biomass. Biomass is organic
  matter that<br />
  comes from recently living plants and organisms. Using wood in your fireplace
  is an <br />
  example of biomass that most people are familiar with.
